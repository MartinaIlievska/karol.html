    <h3><b>2007–2016: Beginnings</b></h3>
    <p>
      In the following years, Giraldo recorded and released songs sporadically,
      including "En la Playa" (On the Beach) in 2007, "Por Ti" (For You) in
      2008, "Dime Que Sí" (Tell Me Yes) in 2009 and "Mil Maneras" (A Thousand
      Ways) in 2010. She studied music at the University of Antioquia and sang
      backup for other artists during her studies, including Reykon, recording
      the songs "Tu Juguete" (Your Toy) in 2011 and "301" in 2012. Shortly
      after, she traveled to Miami to meet with Universal Records, who declined
      to sign her at the time, insinuating that a woman would not be successful
      in the reggaetón genre.

      In response to Universal Music's rejection, Giraldo and her father decided
      to promote her career independently, touring domestically across Colombia
      at colleges, clubs, and festivals. She recalled, "I always said that if
      we'd made money per miles, we'd be millionaires. It was a long process...
      and because of it, I can truly enjoy what's happening now." The increased
      publicity through these tours led to her 2013 collaboration with Nicky Jam
      on the song "Amor de Dos" (The Love of Two).

      However, finding that her music career was not progressing fast enough in
      South America, a disillusioned Giraldo moved to New York in 2014 to work
      and stay with her aunt. Feeling somewhat lost over her lack of success at
      the time, she later said that when taking the NYC Subway each day, to and
      from work, she would see various advertisements offering educational
      courses and certifications for the music business. Taking this as a sign,
      Giraldo eventually decided to enroll in music business administration
      classes. The decision helped reinvigorate her passion for music,
      motivating her to continue furthering her career. Her 2014 dancehall song
      "Ricos Besos" (Sweet Kisses) became a hit in Colombia. In 2016, she signed
      with Universal Music Latino. During that year, she released the singles
      "Casi Nada" (Almost Nothing), "Hello" with then-rising star Ozuna, and
      "Muñeco de Lego" (Lego Doll) as lead-ups to her album release.

    <h3>2017–2018: Breakthrough success and Unstoppable</h3>

      In January 2017, Karol G joined the reality talent show Pequeños Gigantes
      USA (Little Giants) as a judge, offering advice to children 6–11 years of
      age who performed on the show. In February, she released the breakup song
      "A Ella" (To Her), a song inspired by real-life events. In May, her
      collaboration with Puerto Rican trap artist Bad Bunny "Ahora Me Llama"
      (Now He Calls Me) became regarded as her breakthrough hit. The video
      garnered more than one billion views on YouTube and reached #10 on the
      Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The song was described by Marty Preciado
      of NPR as a "bass-heavy, unapologetic trap anthem to the power of
      femininity, soiled in hi-hats and heavy sub-bass [that] challenges
      hegemonic masculinity, singing about respect, love and sex-positive
      decisions." According to Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo, of Rolling Stone, "it
      was then that Giraldo joined the increasingly-global pop urbano wave and
      established herself as one of its most standout acts". "Ahora Me Llama"
      was listed on "Alt. Latino's Favorites: The Songs of 2017" as one of the
      best Latin songs of 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahora Me Llama" served as the main single (including a remix featuring
      Quavo from Migos) for her debut studio album, Unstoppable; the record also
      contained the three aforementioned singles, and was released in October
      2017, debuting at #2 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Thom Jurek
      of AllMusic called Unstoppable "the first solid entry by a woman in the
      Latin trap movement". In March 2018, the singer released the
      jungle-inspired music video for her single "Pineapple". In that same
      month, she was announced as a nominee for the Billboard Latin Music
      Awards' Top Female Artist of the Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 6 April 2018, Karol G collaborated with Argentine singer and songwriter
      Tini on the song "Princesa", from Tini's second studio album Quiero
      Volver.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2018, she released "Mi Cama" (My Bed), which became a commercial
      success. This was followed by "Culpables" (Guilty Ones), featuring Puerto
      Rican rapper (and eventual partner) Anuel AA. "Culpables" peaked at #8 on
      the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, and a remix of "Mi Cama", featuring
      her early collaborators J Balvin and Nicky Jam, peaked at #6 on the same
      chart.

      In January 2019, the singer released the single "Secreto" (Secret) with
      Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA; the song's accompanying music video
      confirmed the rumored romantic relationship between the two artists. The
      single reached #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the US Hot Latin
      Songs charts. The song was inspired by the period of time in which Anuel
      AA and Karol G were dating but had not yet publicly discussed their
      relationship. The video's "power couple" aesthetic garnered comparisons to
      Beyoncé and Jay-Z, as well as Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.[22] Karol
      released the album Ocean on May 3, 2019. The album was inspired by a
      moment of peace and relaxation she experienced at the beach on the Spanish
      Canary Island of Tenerife; she traveled to the beaches of the Turks and
      Caicos Islands, as well as Saint Martin, to draw further inspiration for
      the album. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone reviewed the album by stating,
      "The power of Ocean is somewhat diminished by the fact that a third of
      these songs are already out" but opined that "the remaining tracks are
      impressively varied".
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2019, Karol G collaborated with Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee, Ozuna and
      J Balvin for the song "China". The song samples, and is based on, singer
      Shaggy's 2000 hit, "It Wasn't Me". "China" debuted at #2 on Billboard's
      Hot Latin Songs chart on the issue dated 3 August 2019, and topped both
      the Latin Digital Songs and Latin Streaming Songs charts with 1,000
      downloads sold and 14.1 million streams. "China" was included on the
      Rolling Stone list of the 10 Best Latin Music Videos of July. Karol G
      premiered the song on American television on The Tonight Show Starring
      Jimmy Fallon on 10 January 2020. The song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot
      Latin Songs chart on 23 November 2019 and stayed on the chart for 25
      weeks. Karol G released "Tusa", the first single from her album KG0516, on
      7 November 2019. Tusa, a reggaeton song featuring Nicki Minaj, became a
      commercial success, eventually being nominated for Record of the Year and
      Song of the Year at the 21st Annual Latin Grammy Awards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April 2020, Karol G released the single and video for "Follow" with
      Anuel AA, recording its entirety while in quarantine in Miami due to the
      COVID-19 pandemic. She also collaborated with the Jonas Brothers on the
      "flirtatious" song "X" which first appeared in the end credits of the
      group's documentary film Happiness Continues. Karol G and the Jonas
      Brothers filmed the song's accompanying music video on their iPhones,
      using the combined footage as a "clever way to get around the obvious
      challenge of trying to film a music video during the COVID-19 crisis". In
      October, "Bichota" was released as the album's official lead single,
      becoming viral online.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 17 March 2021, Karol G announced the release of her upcoming album as
      well as its release date and cover art through a half-minute video. The
      tracklist was announced on 22 March, and on 26 March, KG0516 was released.
      Karol G released "Sejodioto" on 21 September 2021. The song became a
      commercial success and was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of
      the Year. In October 2021, Karol G teamed up with Smirnoff for their
      "Sabor for the People" campaign. As part of the deal, her Bichota Tour was
      presented by Smirnoff.

      On 14 February 2022, Karol G and Crocs announced a partnership by
      unveiling two different shoe silhouettes. In April 2022, "Provenza" was
      released as the lead single of the then unannounced album, Mañana Será
      Bonito, becoming viral online. The title refers to a neighborhood of
      Medellín called Provenza. In August 2022 Karol G released "Gatúbela"
      alongside Puerto Rican rapper Maldy from Reggaeton duo Plan B. The song
      features a beat characteristic of old-school, 2000s reggaetón, with a
      dembow rhythm. Its music video was initially banned online in certain
      countries for being sexually provocative, though it was later made
      available as no actual nudity is seen. The video also takes some
      inspiration from older horror movies (as her prowling cat-woman character
      can be seen covered in blood at the end), and is the first to show off
      Karol G's dyed red hair.

      On 19 February 2023, Karol G was among the headlining artists at the

      >
      was released, alongside the collaboration "TQG" with Shakira. The album
      peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming the first-ever
      Spanish-language album by a female artist to debut at No. 1, while the
      collaboration achieved her highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot
      100, peaking at seven. The project garnered seven nominations at the 24th
      Annual Latin Grammy Awards, winning three awards, including Album of the
      Year and Best Urban Music Album, while "TQG" won for Best Urban
      Fusion/Performance. This made Karol G the first woman to win the Latin
      Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album. At the subsequent 66th Annual
      Grammy Awards the album won an award for Best Música Urbana Album.
