      Born and raised in Medellín, Giraldo launched her career as a teenager,
      appearing on the Colombian spinoff of <i>The X Factor</i>. She moved to
      New York in 2014 to learn more about the music industry and signed with
      <i>Universal Music Latino</i>. Her collaboration with Puerto Rican rapper
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny" target="blank"
        >Bad Bunny</a
      >, "Ahora Me Llama" became her breakthrough hit and was the third single
      for her debut album
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_(Karol_G_album)"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>Unstoppable</i></a
      >, released in 2017. In late 2018, her duet "Secreto" became a hit in
      Latin America, as she and Puerto Rican artist <i>Anuel AA</i> publicly
      confirmed their relationship via the music video.
    </p>
    In July 2019, she released "China" in collaboration with <i>Anuel AA</i>,
    <i>Daddy Yankee</i>, <i>Ozuna</i>, and <i>J Balvin</i>, which became her
    first music video with over one billion views on YouTube. In May 2019, she
    released the album
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_(Karol_G_album)"
      target="_blank"
      ><i>Ocean</i></a
    >, which served as a stylistic departure from Unstoppable, incorporating a
    more relaxed and less "pop" sound while incorporating reggaetón influences.
    Popular singles from the album include the title track (later released as a
    remix with Jessie Reyez). Later that year, her song "Tusa" charted
    internationally and was certified 28× Latin platinum by the RIAA. In 2020,
    Giraldo received four nominations at the Latin Grammy Awards. Throughout the
    COVID-19 pandemic, and into early 2021, she would release successful songs,
    including some of her most famous ("Ay, Dios Mío!", "Bichota" and
    "Location"), in the lead-up to her third album,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KG0516" target="_blank"
      ><i>KG0516</i></a
    >, which was released in spring of that year, topping the U.S. Latin albums
    chart.
    <p>
      Giraldo released her fourth album,
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%B1ana_Ser%C3%A1_Bonito"
        target="_blank"
        ><i>Mañana Será Bonito</i></a
      >, in the spring of 2023; the record was immediately recognized as the
      first-ever Spanish-language album by a female artist to debut at No. 1 on
      the U.S. Billboard 200. She achieved her highest-charting single on the
      U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with the song "TQG", a collaboration with fellow
      Colombian singer-songwriter <b>Shakira</b>, reaching the No. 7 position.
      In early 2024, she received her first Grammy Award, at the 66th annual
      ceremony, for the recently created Música Urbana Album category.
