    <h3>Musical style</h3>
    <p>
      Karol G's music has been described as predominantly
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton" target="_blank"
        >Reggaeton</a
      >
      and

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_trap" target="_blank"

      >
      influences. However, she has experimented with a variety of other genres
      in her work. Her album <i>Ocean</i> features a wide range of stylistic
      experimentation. She collaborated with Brazilian duo Simone & Simaria on
      the Spanish/Portuguese song "La Vida Continuó", which contains influences
      from the genre of sertanejo. Karol G cites the global appeal of singers
      Rihanna, Beyoncé, Selena Quintanilla and Shakira as major influences in
      her work and the level of global recognition she hopes to achieve, with
      Rihanna being a "dream" collaboration. Karol G has a tattoo of portraits
      of Rihanna and Quintanilla, along with her own face, on her right forearm.
      Additional influences include Daddy Yankee, Maluma, Rosalía, Gloria Trevi,
      Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera, Ivy Queen, Anahí, Thalía, Spice
      Girls, Jerry Rivera, Bee Gees, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

      Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo of Rolling Stone describes Karol G's style of
      dress as "feminine and sexy, yet sporty and tomboyish — but never
      [cutesy]". Gary Suarez of Vice notes that in her music videos, "she exudes
      a sex positivity that reflects a powerful diva image front and center,
      rather than the eye candy tropes often found in urbano visuals." Karol G
      has a large LGBT following, and the singer expressed admiration for her
      gay fans by explaining, "I love people who can go out into the world and
      be fearless...That's something I admire very much from that community.
      They have a beautiful energy." She declined to record "Sin Pijama" with
      Becky G, which would become a collaboration with Natti Natasha and be a
      hit, because of a lyric about smoking marijuana in the song. Karol G, who
      does not smoke marijuana, felt that the song did not represent her true
      lifestyle. For her album Ocean, Karol G moved away from the polished image
      of the Unstoppable album cover, with the artist explaining, "I did the
      picture with no makeup, super natural. Because that's the way I want
      people to listen to my music now."

      In 2020, Karol G's tweet about her dog's "perfect" color and citing it as
      an example of white and black looking beautiful together sparked
      controversy. She later admitted to have acted in "an ignorant way" at a
      time when Black Lives Matter had gripped America in 2020. Karol G also
      admitted to have "lost a lot of opportunities" in her interview with The
      Guardian.

      month after his release from prison. In January 2019, the couple confirmed
      their relationship. On 25 April 2019, Karol G confirmed engagement to the
      rapper by appearing at the Billboard Latin Music Awards wearing a diamond
      wedding ring. On 20 April 2021, Anuel AA confirmed that he and Karol G had
      ended their relationship and engagement. As of early 2023, Karol G's
      relationship with Colombian musician

        >Gulfstream IV</a
      >
      from Hollywood Burbank Airport to El Salvador International Airport for
      her Mañana Será Bonito Tour, made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport
      due to a report from the pilot of smoke in the cockpit. All 16 passengers
      onboard the plane were evacuated safely with no injuries.
